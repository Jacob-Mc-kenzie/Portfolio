**The Hunt For Zelandia is an educational exploration game set in the sunken continent of Zelandia, just off the coast of New Zeland. Despite being the largest sunken continent not alot of reasearch has been done about it, as such you play an intrepid reasearcher given a grant to map the place.**

Along your journey you will encounter fearsom predators, butiful schools of sea life and serene landscapes. With your supervisor up on land Professor J, be guided to key landmarks and map the sunken continent.

> For This project I was a systems programmer, writing the systems used for the schooling simulations, along with shark AI. I also voiced professor J. This project was developed in Unity.
