**Console Graphics is a fun personal project of mine to develop a fast, responsive UI library for the .Net Console. The library includes the ability to create templated scenes (called Menus) that utilise widgets to rapidly develop GUI applications with code. The library also extends colour support in a pre .Net 5 environment with up to 16 custom colours on screen per frame. In addition, mouse input is supported.**

While technically useable, documentation is still in progress. If you would like to give it a go, visit the wiki tab of the projects GitHub page (linked below) to get started. Feedback is appreciated and if you make something cool I'd love to see it!

> This is an induvidual project of mine and all work associated is my own unless otherwise stated.
